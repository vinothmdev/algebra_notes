# Mathematical Series

## Arithmetic Series

### Definition and Formula

- An arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. The formula to find the $n^{th}$ term of an arithmetic series is:

- $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$

- where  $a_n$  represents the nth term,  $a_1$  is the first term,  $n$  is the position of the term, and  $d$  is the common difference between the terms.

### Sum of an Arithmetic Series

- The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:

- $S_n = (n/2)(a_1 + a_n)$

- where  $S_n$  represents the sum of the first  $n$  terms.

### Examples

- Example 1: Find the 10th term of an arithmetic series if the first term is 2 and the common difference is 3.
Solution: Using the formula, we have:

- $a_10 = 2 + (10-1)3 = 2 + 27 = 29$

- Example 2: Find the sum of the first 15 terms of an arithmetic series if the first term is 5 and the common difference is 2.
Solution: Using the sum formula, we have:

- $S_15 = (15/2)(5 + a_15)$

## Geometric Series

### Definition and Formula

- A geometric series is a sequence of numbers in which each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. The formula to find the nth term of a geometric series is:

- $a_n = a_1 * r^{n-1}$

- where  $a_n$  represents the nth term,  $a_1$  is the first term,  $r$  is the common ratio, and  $n$  is the position of the term.

### Sum of a Geometric Series

- The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:

- $S_n = a_1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)$

- where $S_n$  represents the sum of the first  $n$  terms.

### Examples

- Example 1: Find the 8th term of a geometric series if the first term is 2 and the common ratio is 5.
Solution: Using the formula, we have:

- $a_8 = 2 * 5^{8-1} = 2 * 5^7 = 781250$

- Example 2: Find the sum of the first 10 terms of a geometric series if the first term is 3 and the common ratio is 1/2.
Solution: Using the sum formula, we have:

- $S_10 = 3 * (1 - (1/2)^{10}) / (1 - 1/2)$

## Relationship and Differences

### Relationship

- Arithmetic and geometric series are both types of mathematical series, but they differ in how the subsequent numbers are generated.

- In arithmetic series, the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant, while in geometric series, the ratio between any two consecutive terms is constant.

### Differences

- Formula:

	- Arithmetic series:  $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$
