## Equality of vectors
Two vectors are said to be equal when they have the same magnitude and the same direction.

A vector $A$ is said to be equal to zero when its magnitude $A$ is zero.

A vector is said to be multiplied by a positive scalar when its magnitude is multiplied by that scalar and its direction is left unaltered.

$x(y A) = (xy) A = y (x A)$

A `unit vector` is one whose magnitude is unity.

The negative sign, -, prefixed to a vector reverses its direction but leaves its magnitude unchanged.

The sum or resultant of two vectors is found by placing the origin of the second upon the terminus of the first and drawing the vector from the origin of the first to the terminus of the second.

The order in which two vectors $S$ and $T$ are added does not affect the sum.

$I_a : m (n A) = n (m A) = (m n) A,$

$I_b : (A + B) + C = A + (B + C),$

$II : A + B = B + A,$

$III_a : (m + n) A = m A + n A,$

$III_b : m (A + B) = m A + m B,$

$III_c : - (A + B) = - A - B.$

>>>  The laws which govern addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication of vectors are identical with those governing these operations in ordinary scalar algebra.
